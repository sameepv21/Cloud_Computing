# Introduction
* Virtualization - converting any physical hardware to handle multiple requests or threads (limited threads).
* Service oriented computing
    * Modern paradigm
    * strong business model

# Terminologies
* Distributed System
    * Multiple resources connected by networks and not located at one physical location.
    * They work in a collaborative manner.
    * Issues
        * Maintainability
        * Reliability - Both performance oritented and otherwise
        * Sync - Terminate threads in same state. share results to master threads.
        * Concurrency
* Distributed Computing
    * Computational tasks performed on distributed system.
    * Distributed programs that use resources of distributed system.
* Middleware
    * Required for certain processes that operating system can't perform.
* RPC
* IDL
* Data Marshalling
