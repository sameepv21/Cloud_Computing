* Cloud is not new tech
* Cloud is pay-as-you-go model which means you use a service and pay according to it.
* VMM is virtual machine monitor is a piece of software that provides all kinds of resources to a hardware and processes.
* Operating system is an extended machine provider because it uses one physical machines to provide the user many different virtual machines.
    * As a result, the process thinks that it has the whole machine.
* Usually, even for big companies, the utilization was 15-25% which meant most of the resources are underutilized.
* Solution was to run more than 1 application in the same server.

# Cluster Computing
* Same hardware and software should be there.
* Good network is required
* Common Task must be subdivided.
* Parallel Computing is one of the most important concept for this.
* MPI (Message Passing Interface) - A c++ implementation, acting like a switch between all homogeneous systems.

# Grid Computing
* Comprehensive and complete paradigm.
* Don't require homogeneous systems.
* Can be at different physical locations too.
* Mostly used for scientific computation.
* Problem was that there was no business infrastructure and hence couldn't gain any attention.
