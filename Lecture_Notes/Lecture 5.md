* In lecture 3 and 4, run RPC and RMI code and differentiate between them.
* RMI has a dispatcher through which all the requests are proceeded to the server.

# Extras
* Containers isolate the runtime environment so that irrespective of the configuration of the system on which the program is running.
* Virtual machines are instances of particular server that is remotely located.
* Virtual managers are required to address varied operating systems, hardware architecture and various programming languages or portability.

# Types of computing
* High-Performance Computing - Super computers.
* Cluster Computing - Combine multiple small resources and combine to form powerful processing system. All the connected reources need to have similar configurations.
* Peer-to-Peer computing - This is decentralized model unlike HPC centralized model.
* Internet computing - Internet provides support for establishing connection server and client. Boost **collaborative** computing. Basic infrastructure was distributed system.
* Grid Computing - Group of networked computers which work together as a virtual super computer. Biggest difference is there is no guarantee about resources and computing power. There is not requierement of having same configuration unlike cluster computing.
* Service-Oriented Computing - Distributed computing, software is accessed as a service that is loosely coupled (means that method or object of class is independent of another method or object or class), protocol independent and standards-based.
* Cloud Computing - Virtually execute codes and programs.
